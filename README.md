# Safe-Cracking-Challenge
A repo to track people's attempts at the safe cracking challenge and store their submissions.  

# Challenge Description
The challenge is to write code that will run on an Arduino UNO to crack one of our toy "safes". See the repo wiki for more details. 
The objective is to write this code so that it has the smallest possible program size that is written to program memory. 
The cracker must halt once it's found the correct code.
